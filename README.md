# advent of code [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zuzak/adventofcode.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/zuzak/adventofcode)


[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) was a programming challenge in December 2015.

This repository holds some solutions, written in [Pike 7.8](http://pike.lysator.liu.se), which
were created as procrastination from an impending university assignment. Others are written in Python,
because the questions got difficult!
